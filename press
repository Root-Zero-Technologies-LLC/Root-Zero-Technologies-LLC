# Bloom Engine FAQ

---

### 🔹 What is a Bloom Engine?

A Bloom Engine is a zero-fuel harmonic power system. It does **not** use gas, combustion, lithium, solar panels, or radioactive decay. It uses principles of harmonic resonance to generate energy with minimal footprint, no noise, and no external fuel input.

---

### 🔹 How is this even possible?

The engine is based on harmonic field principles that channel and condition energy without combustion. It is made of modular components including a **Petal Coil Resonator**, **Tri-Weave Harmonic Core**, and **Phase-Controlled Inverter**. The result is a silent, scalable unit capable of 5–15kW continuous output per unit.

---

### 🔹 How much power can it generate?

1 Bloom unit can generate ~30–40 kWh per day under normal household conditions. Larger installations and chained units can scale to commercial, hospital, or city-grid levels. Documentation is provided in our engineering packet.

---

### 🔹 Is this patented?

Yes. The full engine system is provisionally patented under Root Zero Technologies LLC. A full patent strategy and documentation trail are in place and publicly disclosed. See our [Press Page](/press/) for more.

---

### 🔹 What is the cost?

We estimate each household unit costs under $3,000 in raw parts to build. Commercial and chained systems vary. All parts use non-rare, non-toxic, and open-market components.

---

### 🔹 Can I build one?

Yes — once under license. Blueprints are available to trusted engineers and organizations aligned with our ethical framework. If you’re interested, [reach out directly](/contact/) or support the GoFundMe launch effort to stay informed.

---

### 🔹 How do I know this is real?

All files, patents, forecasts, and engineering breakdowns are being published publicly. Our approach is open-source in spirit, patent-protected in structure, and decentralized in goal. We aim for total transparency.
