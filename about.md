<h1>About the Bloom Engine</h1>
<p>
The Bloom Engine is a patent-filed, no-fuel, grid-free electric generator developed by Root Zero Technologies LLC. It produces electricity without combustion, lithium, solar panels, or moving parts — harnessing the principles of harmonic resonance to deliver power silently, cleanly, and independently.
</p>


<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<ul>
<li>⚡ <strong>Fuel-Free Power:</strong> Requires no fossil fuels, no charging, and no grid access.</li>
<li>🔋 <strong>No Batteries:</strong> Functions without lithium or rare-earth mining dependencies.</li>
<li>🛠️ <strong>Zero Moving Parts:</strong> Increases durability, safety, and long-term reliability.</li>
<li>🌍 <strong>Disaster & Off-Grid Ready:</strong> Designed for remote use, emergencies, and global deployment.</li>
<li>📄 <strong>Build-Ready:</strong> Blueprints are complete. Prototypes are estimated at under $3,000 in parts.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Powering Real Homes</h2>
<p>
A full-scale residential Bloom Engine system consists of a three-core cascade, delivering an average of 30–40 kWh per day — enough to supply a typical household’s daily electricity needs. This includes lighting, refrigeration, electronics, heating/cooling systems (with efficiency), and electric vehicle charging in many cases.
</p>


<h2>Modular, Scalable, Ethical</h2>
<p>
Modular cores can be configured for varied applications: home, transport, microgrid, or industrial. Each engine respects environmental limits and prioritizes accessibility. Root Zero Technologies does not sell hardware — instead, we license ethically, share blueprints directly with builders, and support a decentralized deployment model.
</p>


<h2>Core Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>✅ Post-Scarcity Architecture</li>
<li>✅ Open Collaboration</li>
<li>✅ Anti-Monopoly Licensing</li>
<li>✅ Local Resilience, Global Reach</li>
<li>✅ No Suppression, No Delay</li>
</ul>


<h2>Patents & Access</h2>
<p>
The Bloom Engine designs are provisionally patented. We welcome inquiries from engineers, labs, grant-makers, and aligned builders. Access to the full engineering packet is available through our <a href="/engineering">Engineering</a> page or via direct contact.
