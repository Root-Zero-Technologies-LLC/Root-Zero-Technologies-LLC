# Engineering Overview

The Bloom Engine is a patent-filed, fuel-free electrical generator designed for decentralized use. It produces electricity with **no combustion, no lithium, and no external input fuel**. The system has **zero moving parts**, is **build-ready**, and designed to be replicated by engineers or licensed manufacturing partners globally.

---

## ⚙️ Build Requirements

Each Bloom Engine unit (Residential Cascade variant) can produce:

- **30–40 kWh/day** output
- Designed for **small mesh-grid networks**
- Operates in **off-grid or disaster conditions**
- **Part cost estimate:** $2,800–$3,000 USD

> 🧰 Assembly requires basic tools, precision measurement instruments, and knowledge of electromagnetic construction.

## 🧪 Engineering Philosophy

Root Zero Technologies was founded on three non-negotiable principles:

1. **Open-Access to Truthful Innovation**  
   No good invention should be buried or suppressed.

2. **Decentralized Replication**  
   We believe in empowering local engineers to replicate and adapt systems globally.

3. **Resonance, Not Resistance**  
   Our systems are designed for harmony with the planet and one another — not domination.
