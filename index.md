<section class="intro">
<h1>Welcome to Root Zero Technologies LLC</h1>
<p>
We develop revolutionary no-fuel energy engines designed to function without gas, combustion, lithium, or solar panels. These systems are fully blueprint-ready, provisionally patented, and built for resilience, decentralization, and global energy independence.

<h2>Clarifying Output: Bloom Engine Types</h2>
<p>
There are multiple engine classes within the Bloom family, each tuned for different use cases. The engine featured in our public launch is the <strong>Residential Bloom Zero</strong>, designed to produce approximately <strong>30–40 kWh/day</strong>, sufficient for full home energy independence in most standard U.S. households. This estimate refers to a <em>single residential deployment</em>, which may include multiple interconnected Bloom cores depending on the installation.
</p>
<p>
Earlier internal documents referenced smaller modular cores producing <strong>7–10 kWh/day</strong> individually. These modules form the scalable basis of the full residential system. All public-facing materials reflect the <em>complete deployment bundle</em> as a unit — this distinction will be further detailed in the technical pages and blog section.
