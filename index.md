<h2>Clarifying Output: Bloom Engine Types</h2>
<p>
There are multiple engine classes within the Bloom family, each tuned for different use cases. The engine featured in our public launch is the <strong>Residential Bloom Zero</strong>, designed to produce approximately <strong>30–40 kWh/day</strong>, sufficient for full home energy independence in most standard U.S. households. This estimate refers to a <em>single residential deployment</em>, which may include multiple interconnected Bloom cores depending on the installation. Residential models are larger than micro-models.
</p>
<p>
Earlier internal documents referenced smaller modular cores producing <strong>7–10 kWh/day</strong> individually. These modules form the scalable basis of the full residential system. All public-facing materials reflect the <em>complete deployment bundle</em> as a unit — this distinction will be further detailed in the technical pages and blog section. Bloom engines exponentially scale in individual power generation per bloom engine linked together in grid-formations, which can be opt in.
